    <p class="welcome">Welcome to CineView! The website that will allow you to stay up to date with
    film news, will offer a helping hand when you're not sure what to watch and to get
    you involved in the community of like minded film buffs!</p>
    <p>For over 100 years movies have been a staple in our every day lives.</p>
    <h2>Coming Soon</h2>
    <p>Click the movie poster to watch the trailer!</p>
    <!--An automatic image carousel was ideal for this coming soon feature as it would display a number of different film posters
      to the user and allow them to click each one individually. *This code was sourced from https://designshack.net/articles/css/infinitephotobanner/ *
      This was chosen over an automatic slideshow as it was wanting to appear as a continous stream, like an old camera film, and this effect could not
      be created using the slideshow.-->

<p class="boxs">"Signs (2002) is the best alien movie I have ever seen (it made me puke from fear when I was a kid)" - Daniel Loss</p>
<p class="boxs">"I would give them 20 years before they start having thoughts about re-doing franchises like the Lord of the Rings films or the Harry Potter films. When they feel like they need to "breed new fans" even at the expense of confusing the hell out of the chronological releases and potentially chance of confusing the source material even more." - Sam Wright</p>
<p class="boxs">"The two of my most favorite movies are The Groundhog Day and My Cousin Vinny. What do these two have in common apart from being light-hearted comedies? Southern Accent. I love the accent! My Cousin Vinney had this opposition lawyer who had a southern accent and in the movie Groundhog Day it was Andie McDowell who I think had a slight Southern accent." - Daniel Mishy</p>
